# From C to C++, the right way

## Purpose
This repo contains some coding examples for you to go from C to C++.
The purpose is for you to **L**earn **B**y **E**xample, the real benefits.
You will gradually change your thinking from **procedural** to **conceptual**
and learn how to reduce errors by actually defining constraints that the
compiler can _enforce_, and more.

# Intended audience
These coding examples are written for people with at least some experience from writing software in C. The examples attempt to be generic enough to be valid for both **workstation/server-** and **_embedded_** - applications.

The code is written and maintained on a Debian Linux workstation. A few tests are validated on Raspberry-PICO, to validate the embedded examples properly. This should be easy enough to run on MacOS, but on Windows you may have to install **Cygwin** or use a virtual machine.

>   **Note!** All code is compiled using the **C++** compiler,
>   this may hide some differences. But that's not in focus here!

**TBC**
