# Purpose
This repo contains some coding examples for you to go from C to C++.
The purpose is for you to **L**earn **B**y **E**xample, the real benefits. 
You will gradually change your thinking from **procedural** to **conceptual**
and learn how to reduce errors by actually defining constraints that the 
compiler can _enforce_, and more.

**TBC**
